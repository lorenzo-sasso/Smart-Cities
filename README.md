# Smart-Cities governance & technology
Creating a way for bicycles and pedestrians to substitute the tram line 179 which covers SP44 and links Limbiate(MB), Paderno Dugnano(MI) and other town halls in the north of Milan with the first stop of the yellow underground Comasina M3. Our idea arises from the structure and strategical position of this street: straight and passing through many town halls.
